# Car Price Prediction using various regression models
Regression in machine learning is a technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. It's used as a method for predictive modeling, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.

In this project, I have predicted the prices of cars using different types of Regression algorithms which are:
1.  Linear Regression
2.  Decision Tree Regressor
3.  Random Forest Regressor
