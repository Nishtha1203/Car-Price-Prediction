In this project, I have predicted the prices of cars using different types of Regression techniques which are
1.  Linear Regression
2.  Decision Tree Regressor
3.  Random Forest Regressor
   
   The best accuracy of the model for training and testing data came out to be 97.85% and 90.83% respectively using Random Forest Regressor.
